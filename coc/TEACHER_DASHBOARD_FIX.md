# Teacher Dashboard Fix Summary

## Problem
The teacher dashboard was showing fatal PDO errors due to missing database columns:
1. `SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 've.lesson_execution' in 'field list'`
2. `SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'v.visit_time' in 'order clause'`

## Root Cause
The teacher dashboard was using old column names from a previous database schema:
- `ve.lesson_execution` and `ve.classroom_management` (don't exist)
- `v.visit_time` (doesn't exist)

But the actual database structure uses:
- `visit_evaluations` table with `indicator_id` and `score` columns
- `visits` table with only `visit_date` (no separate time column)

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Average Performance Query
**Old:**
```sql
SELECT AVG((ve.lesson_execution + ve.classroom_management) / 2) as avg_score
FROM visits v
INNER JOIN visit_evaluations ve ON v.id = ve.visit_id
WHERE v.teacher_id = ?
```

**New:**
```sql
SELECT AVG(ve.score) as avg_score
FROM visits v
INNER JOIN visit_evaluations ve ON v.id = ve.visit_id
WHERE v.teacher_id = ?
```

### 2. Simplified Performance Categories
Since the new database structure doesn't separate lesson execution and classroom management, I set both categories to use the same overall performance value:
```php
$stats['avg_lesson'] = $stats['avg_performance'];
$stats['avg_management'] = $stats['avg_performance'];
```

### 3. Updated Recent Visits Query
**Old:**
```sql
SELECT v.*, s.name as subject_name, vt.name as visitor_name,
       sec.name as section_name, g.name as grade_name,
       ve.lesson_execution, ve.classroom_management
FROM visits v
...
ORDER BY v.visit_date DESC, v.visit_time DESC
```

**New:**
```sql
SELECT v.*, s.name as subject_name, vt.name as visitor_name,
       sec.name as section_name, g.name as grade_name,
       AVG(ve.score) as avg_score
FROM visits v
...
GROUP BY v.id
ORDER BY v.visit_date DESC, v.created_at DESC
```

### 4. Updated HTML Display
**Old:**
```php
<?php if ($visit['lesson_execution'] && $visit['classroom_management']): ?>
    $total_score = ($visit['lesson_execution'] + $visit['classroom_management']) / 2;
    // Display individual scores and visit_time
<?php endif; ?>
```

**New:**
```php
<?php if ($visit['avg_score']): ?>
    $total_score = ($visit['avg_score'] / 3) * 100; // Convert from 3-point scale to percentage
    // Display overall average, removed visit_time reference
<?php endif; ?>
```

### 5. Fixed Join References
- Changed `visitor_id` to `visitor_type_id` in the visits join
- Removed `visit_time` references (column doesn't exist)

## Result
- ✅ Teacher dashboard now loads without PDO errors
- ✅ Performance statistics show overall averages based on the new indicator-based evaluation system
- ✅ Recent visits display correctly with proper dates
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility in the UI while using the correct database structure

## Result
- Teacher dashboard now loads without errors
- Performance statistics show overall averages based on the new indicator-based evaluation system
- Maintains backward compatibility in the UI while using the correct database structure

## Current Database Structure
The `visit_evaluations` table uses:
- Each visit can have multiple evaluation records (one per indicator)
- Each record has an `indicator_id` and a `score` (typically 1-3 scale)
- Overall performance is calculated as the average of all indicator scores

This is more flexible than the old two-column approach and allows for different evaluation criteria.
